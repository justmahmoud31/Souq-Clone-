- CRUD operations for products, categories,Brand,and subcategories
- Cart management
- Product filtering by category and subcategory

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express,typeScript,ts-node
- **Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **Development Tools:** Nodemon, Postman
- **Others:** Bcrypt for password hashing, dotenv for environment variable management

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed (version 14.x or higher)
- MongoDB installed and running locally or via a cloud service (e.g., MongoDB Atlas)

3. Run the project:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The project will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Running the Project

The project is set up to run using Nodemon, which automatically restarts the server on file changes. To run the project, simply execute:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and watch for changes.

## API Documentation

The API provides various endpoints for managing users, products, categories, and subcategories. Below are some key endpoints:
it will be here soon 

## Project Structure

The project follows a Domain-driven structure:

- `controllers`: Handles the logic for each route.
- `models`: Defines the Mongoose schemas.
- `routes`: Defines the API endpoints.
- `middlewares`: Custom middleware (e.g., error handling, authentication).
- `utils`: Utility functions (e.g., AppError, JWT handling).
- `modules`: Contains route ,controllers
